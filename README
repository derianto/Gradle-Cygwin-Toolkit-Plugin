Gradle Cygwin Toolkit Plugin
----------------------------
Provides some utilities to determine if the the environment is a cygwin environment,
and some methods to convert UNIX paths to Windows path, Cygwin paths, or file:///
style path using Cygwin's cygpath tool.

This toolkit is a reaction to the author's frustration with dealing with various
path issues encountered when writing gradle scripts in cygwin environment, e.g.
when passing a path to file() method, or when writing WAR path in a Jetty
context file.  In fact, now crossEnvPath(path) method in this toolkit converts any
path to a form consumable by those cases.

To use, simply insert this line into your build script:

  apply from: 'CygwinPlugin.gradle'

The file build.gradle in the repo contains example uses.
